# How to run

Command to run Multi-task transformers: `docker run --rm --gpus all multitask-transformer`

# Task 1 
Code for Task 1 is present in `main.py` in the function `sentence_embeddings()`. I've used ***distilbert-base-uncased*** to get sentence embeddings.

# Task 2
Code for Task 2 is in model.py. I've added 2 extra layers to transformer to handle sentence classificaiton and sentimental analysis.

# Task 3
Answers for Task 3 are present in ***Task3.txt***.

# Task 4
Code for Task 4 is inside `main.py` in the function `train()`. This function will handle the training loop, hypothetical data and the metrics.
